abstract = "The interest in text as data has seen a sharp increase in the past few years, mostly due to the advent of methods for automated text analysis. At the same time, researches within the field of scientometrics have analysed citations and other aspects of the scholarly literature with great sophistication. The archival content of [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org) offers a rich and diverse set of primary sources like research articles or book chapters for both approaches. [Data for Research (DfR)](https://www.jstor.org/dfr/) by JSTOR gives all researchers, regardless of whether they have access to JSTOR or not, the opportunity to analyse metadata, n-grams and, upon special request, full-text materials about all available articles and books from JSTOR. The package jstor helps in analysing these datasets by enabling researchers to easily import the metadata to R, a task, for which no other integrated solution exists to date."
# abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
