<p>There are numerous reasons, why one would have a personal blog or website. Over the last few weeks, quite a few of them accumulated until I thought, I’d give it a go. Besides the urge of having a place where I could develop ideas and comment on certain topics, in a few weeks time I will give a talk together with a colleague at a conference, and we plan to make available some intermediate outcomes of our research, in this case a package for R which I wrote. This site will be a very good place to showcase the package and further directions our research might take.</p>
<p>So, what content are you going to find here in the future? I plan to write about small or larger (coding) projects I take on, about my developing research, and probably some random thoughts about Austrian politics and society.</p>
<p>Starting a blog with the use of blogdown feels almost like cheating – for sure, there are aspects to learn, options to set, problems to wrap your head around. But all in all, the process is quite straightforward, thanks to Yihui Xie’s <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">package</a> and the most helpful documentation at <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/</a>.</p>
<p>In starting website with a blog I want to mention a few sites I really enjoy reading, and to which I owe inspirational credit for my own page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rud.is/b/" class="uri">https://rud.is/b/</a> by Bob Rudis</li>
<li><a href="https://juliasilge.com" class="uri">https://juliasilge.com</a> by Julia Silge</li>
<li><a href="http://varianceexplained.org" class="uri">http://varianceexplained.org</a> by David Robinson</li>
<li><a href="http://www.masalmon.eu/" class="uri">http://www.masalmon.eu/</a> by Maëlle Salmon</li>
<li><a href="https://www.data-imaginist.com" class="uri">https://www.data-imaginist.com</a> by Thomas Lin Pedersen</li>
</ul>
<p>A special piece of inspiration was a series of posts (<a href="http://www.masalmon.eu/2017/04/23/radioswissclassic/">1</a>, <a href="http://www.masalmon.eu/2017/04/30/radioedit/">2</a>) by Maëlle about the music which airs on <em>Radio Swiss classic</em>. I wondered, how the program of Austrian radio stations like <a href="https://radioklassik.at">radio klassik Stephansdom</a> would compare, and I will try to explore this comparison in one of my future posts.</p>
