Being home on a Sunday afternoon has many positive aspects, one of which a few
days ago
was to witness the sun's rays floating into the rooms. After rather short and
grey days
of winter, the day I realise the sun is once again shining directly in my rooms,
I am always very happy.

Every now and then I think about the times for sunrise and sundown, 
which I usually look up
at the
[Austrian Institute for Meterology and Geodynamic (ZAMG)](https://www.zamg.ac.at/cms/de/klima/klimauebersichten/ephemeriden)
to see, how fast days are getting longer. I will use this opportunity
to visualise the patterns of sunrise and sunset for my current hometown, which
is Graz in the south of Austria.

# Get the data
First, we need to load some packages. Since I want to scrape the times for
sunrise
and sunset from the page of ZAMG, we need to load `rvest` alongside the usual
`tidyverse`. 


```{r, message=FALSE}
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

theme_set(hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum(base_family = "Hind"))
```

Before we scrape, we need to check, whether we are allowed to, or not.
```{r, message=FALSE}
link <- "https://www.zamg.ac.at/cms/de/klima/klimauebersichten/ephemeriden/graz/?jahr=2018"

robotstxt::paths_allowed(link)
```
Seems to be OK.

After that, we go ahead to scrape the table of sunrise and sunset times.
In order to find the appropriate tag for `html_node()`, I always use
[selectorgadget](http://selectorgadget.com). Luckily the table
is quite accessible, we simply need to select one node and extract the table.
Since the column headings are duplicated and `tibble`s don't like this, I set
appropriate columns manually.

```{r}
page <- read_html(link)

times <- page %>% 
  html_node(".dynPageTable") %>%
  html_table() %>% 
  set_names(c("day", "month", "year", "sunrise", "sunset",
              "moonrise", "moonset")) %>% 
  as_tibble()
times
```


The table looks OK, but in order to do some plotting, we need to combine the 
information on day, month and year into one column. 
```{r}
sun_times <- times %>% 
  mutate(date = paste(year, month, day, sep = "-") %>% ymd()) 
sun_times
```



# Plot the data
For this data I want to have the date from first of January to 31st of December
on the x-axis, and the times of day when the sun rises and sets on the y-axis.
For this, we need to gather our data, and then create a slightly hacky time
variable. Since there is no class for time without date, I combine the
information on sunset and sunrise times with today's date.

```{r}
gathered_times <- sun_times %>% 
  gather(type, time, sunrise, sunset) %>% 
  select(date, type, time) %>% 
  mutate(time = paste0(today(), "-", time) %>% ymd_hm())
gathered_times
```

```{r}
ggplot(gathered_times, aes(date, time, colour = type)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_datetime(date_breaks = "2 hours", date_labels = "%H:%M") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "Sunset and sunrise in Graz (Austria)")
```
This already looks quite nice. We can clearly see the jumps in sunrise and sunset
times that stem from daylight-saving. 


For the final graph to look a bit prettier, I would like to add a few
annotations:

1. get rid of the legend and annotate inside the plot
2. show a vertical line of today, with today's length of day.

Let's prepare those annotations:
```{r}
labels <- tribble(~date,             ~type,     ~time,
                  ymd("2018-07-01"), "sunrise", ymd_hm("2018-02-13-07:00"),
                  ymd("2018-07-01"), "sunset",  ymd_hm("2018-02-13-19:00"))


# calculate todays length of day
day_length <- gathered_times %>% 
  filter(date == today()) %>% 
  spread(type, time) %>% 
  mutate(day_length = sunset - sunrise) %>% 
  pull(day_length) %>% 
  round(2) %>% 
  as.character()



```

And let's plot the graph.
```{r}
ggplot(gathered_times, aes(date, time, colour = type)) +
  geom_line(show.legend = F) +
  scale_y_datetime(date_breaks = "2 hours", date_labels = "%H:%M") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = today(), colour = "#4DAF4A") +
  geom_text(data = labels, aes(label = type), show.legend = F) +
  annotate("text", x = today() + 85, y = ymd_hm(paste(today(), "12:30", sep = "-")),
           label = paste0("Today's length of day: ", day_length, " hours."),
           colour = "#4DAF4A") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "Sunset and sunrise in Graz (Austria)")
```

Ten hours and ~14 minutes `(0.23 * 60 = 13.8)` of possible daylight is not that much, but
not bad either. In order to have better chances of having sunlight in my face, 
however, I
should probably be getting up earlier, so I can walk back home from university
before the sun has set. `r emo::ji("sunrise")`
Maybe this will finally change my habits for when to get
up, although I doubt it a bit
`r emo::ji("man_shrugging_medium_light_skin_tone")`.
