This is a static site, and there is no data being processed by me. The site
however uses certain services from third parties to enable features like
comments.

The site is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). They create access
logs for this homepage and store your IP address for not more than 30 days.

I use Google Analytics to track activity on my page. In this process, your 
IP-address is anonymised and sent to Google Analytics. Thus, no personal 
information is being forwarded. 
If you still want to opt out from being tracked by Google Analytics on my site, 
<a onclick="alert('Tracking by Google Analytics has been disabled in your browser for this site.')" href="javascript:gaOptout()">opt out by clicking here</a>.
You can find more information on how Google uses data and what you can to
prevent it [here](https://privacy.google.com/your-data.html).

For blogposts, I use [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) to power comments. Disqus
should not be setting cookies for visitors from EU locations.
You can opt out of any tracking from Disqus
[here](https://disqus.com/data-sharing-settings/)
and review their privacy policy 
[here](https://help.disqus.com/commenting/gdpr-delete-or-access-user-data).

If you have any further concerns or requests, please contact me at
