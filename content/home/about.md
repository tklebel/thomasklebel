My name is Thomas Klebel and I am a sociologist. I work as a 
senior researcher in the 
[Open and Reproducible Research Group](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/isds/research/groups/orrg/)
at Know-Center Research GmbH in Graz.

In my research, I investigate unintended consequences of current implementations of Open Research, ways of improving the reproducibility of research findings, and avenues for sustainable business models around open research infrastructure.

Although equipped with training and experience in various methods of conducting research, my main focus has been on quantitative methods of inquiry. I'm particularly interested in causal modelling and ways of improving empirical research practice broadly conceived. 

I completed my doctoral studies in Sociology in 2024 and also hold a degree in Music Performance from the University of Performing Arts Graz. <a rel="me" href="https://scicomm.xyz/@tklebel"></a>
