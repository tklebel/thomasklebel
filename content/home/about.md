# About

My name is Thomas Klebel and I am a sociologist. Currently I working as a 
researcher and Data Scientist in the 
[Open and Reproducible Research Group](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/isds/research/groups/orrg/)
at Graz University of Technology. Starting with March 2020, I will work as
project manager and reseracher in the H2020 project 
[ON-MERRIT](https://on-merrit.eu).

My thesis in sociology was on social mobility, but I spend most of my 
professional time now researching questions on scholarly communication, 
bibliometrics and research integrity. Luckily, this also involves munging, 
analysing and visualising data which I quite enjoy.

Although my focus has been on sociology and stats/data science for a few years 
now, I initially
trained as a musician, receiving a BA for playing the cello.
