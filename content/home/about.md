# About

My name is Thomas Klebel and I am a sociologist. Currently I am pursuing my 
master studies in sociology at the University of Graz, where I also work
part-time as a research assistant at the Department of Sociology.

My research interests in sociology are focussed on issues of class,
inequality and social mobility. My work as a research assistant is concerned
with questions of the academic elite within sociology. Through sociology I came 
into contact with statistics and data visualisation, which I'm very passionate
about.

Although my focus has been on sociology and stats/data science for a few years 
now, I initially
trained as a musician, receiving a BA for playing the cello.
