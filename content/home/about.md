My name is Thomas Klebel and I am a sociologist. I work as a 
project manager and researcher  in the 
[Open and Reproducible Research Group](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/isds/research/groups/orrg/)
at Know-Center GmbH in Graz. From March 2020 to March 2022, I was
project manager and researcher for the H2020 project 
[ON-MERRIT](https://on-merrit.eu).

My master's thesis in sociology was on social mobility, but I spend most of my 
professional time now researching questions on scholarly communication, 
bibliometrics and open science. For my PhD, I research potential negative 
side-effects of Open Science within the academic publishing system.

Although my focus has been on sociology and stats/data science for a few years 
now, I initially trained as a musician, receiving a BA for playing the cello.
